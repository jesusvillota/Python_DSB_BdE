    "### 1. Overview of setup and installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Python?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. It acts as a translator, abstracting away the  details of computers and enabling us to communicate with them using a language that's easier for humans to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python emphasizes readability, making it *straightforward* to write and understand code. It supports various programming paradigms, including procedural, where we provide a sequence of instructions; object-oriented, where we create objects with data and perform actions on them; and functional programming, where code is organized around functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, Python is widely used across diverse applications, from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing. Over the years, Python has transitioned from a specialized scientific computing language to a key player in data science, machine learning, and software development, thanks to its extensive open-source libraries and its adaptability to construct sophisticated data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Python?**\n",
    "- Python is widely used, increasing the availability of resources that we, as end-users, can leverage.\n",
    "- Python is free and open-source.\n",
    "- Python is connected to many software platforms. This kind of integration with other software allows us to expand the functionality of software packages and customize solutions for specific data analysis needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, setting up a Python environment for data science is not straightforward. We need an environment that contains all the packages/libraries in a compatible way. Achieving this isn't always easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation** \n",
    "\n",
    "We can just install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This installation would have us equipped to write and run code directly from our terminal. However, this approach is rather unintuitive, especially for beginners who are just getting started with programming. That's where text editors come into play. Text editors provide a more user-friendly interface for writing and organizing code, offering features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and project management tools, making the coding process more intuitive and efficient for programmers of any level. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) as editor (aka **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment). VSCode is a very popular editor because it supports almost any language and, by downloading the right extensions, we can addapt the coding to all levels of programming. In this course we will use all the Python extensions and the Jupyter Notebook ones (*python, pylance, jupyter, jupyter cell tags, jupyter keymap, jupyter notebook renderers, jupyter slide show, python indent, python debugger, Python extended*)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the native Python installation we get a subset of basic packages, but to this environment we need to include the packages/libraries that we need for our particular tasks. Packages are extensions to the basic Python environment developed by the community. Putting it in simple words, we could say they are a collection of scripts that define a new set of functions, data type and methods that allow further manipulation of our data. Because the architechture of all of this packages is highly interlinked, it is easy to run into incompatibilities installing our packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why Python distributors like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) become useful, particularly because it allows us to install [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html), which is a very powerful package and environment manager. In particular, when we use conda to install a package it downloads a version of the package that has already been compiled for our specific operating system and architecture. Furthermore, Conda resolves package dependencies automatically, avoiding conflicts and installation failures. It also enables users to create isolated environments for projects, ensuring clean and reproducible development environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure we all have the same working environment, we will follow the installation guideline provided by Joël. After you have downloaded Anaconda and VSCode and Anaconda, we download the environment configuration file (https://datascience.joelmarbet.com/environment.yml). Environment files (with the .yml extension) are files that contain all the dependencies and settings for a Conda environment. This file allows users to recreate the exact environment with all necessary dependencies by simply running a comand on the Conda terminal, making it easier to share and reproduce environments across different systems.\n",
    "This means that if we all install the same configuration file, we will be sharing the same conda computational environment (i.e., same packages, versions, environment name). Just to review the instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After downloading Anacona and the `environment.yml` file, we open a terminal (Mac) or the Anaconda Terminal (Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We change the directory to the folder where we have stored the downloaded file by typing `cd path/to/environment`, where `path/to/environment` is the folder containing the environment configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To create the environment we type: `conda env create -f environment.yml` \n",
    "\n",
    "4. We check the installation by activating the environment: `conda activate datascience_course_cemfi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We test the Python version: `python --version`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In VSCode, we have to make sure we have downloaded all the relevant extensions and then, we open a new notebook, we should be able to select the new environment to run our code. "

    "### 1. Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The way in which we will interact with Python code will be through Jupyter Notebooks on VSCode.  Jupyter Notebooks, as well as the popular Jupyter Lab, are all part of the [**Jupyter Project**](https://jupyter.org/try) which revolves around the provision of tools and standards for interactive computing across different computing languages(**Ju**lia,**Py**thon,**R**) through computational notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks is an example of **computational notebook**. Notebooks merge code, plain language explanations, data, and visualizations into a shareable document. A notebook offers a rapid interactive platform for code typing, data exploration, visualization, and idea sharing, stemming from the belief that the most effective way to learn and program is through hands-on interaction with code. That is, we can pool together in a single file (**a notebook**) all data workflow behind our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, notebooks capture interactive session inputs and outputs along with explanatory text providing a comprehensive computational record. The notebook file, saved with the .ipynb extension, is internally JSON files, allowing for version control and easy sharing. Additionally, notebooks can be exported to various static formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks replace the traditional console-based interactive computing by introducing a web-based application that captures the entire computation process: from code development and documentation to execution and result communication. The Jupyter notebook integrates both elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A web application** (although we will use VSCode rather than the browser based extension): This browser-based editing program enables interactive authoring of computational notebooks, offering a swift environment for code prototyping, data exploration, visualization, and idea sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computational Notebook documents**: These shareable documents combine computer code, plain language explanations, data, visualizations and interactive controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook interacts with kernels, which are implementations of the Jupyter interactive computing protocol specific to different programming languages. In plain words, *kernels* are the separate process that interprets and executes our code in a given programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "From Jupyter on VSCode we can just open a new Jupyter Notebook on **File** &rarr; **New File**  &rarr; **Jupyter Notebook**. When we open a new notebook, we will find the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Notebooks on VSCode](./img1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Toolbar of VSCode. \n",
    "2. Name of our new notebook: notice that when a white point appears is because there are unsaved changes. Notice that notebooks have the **.ipynb** extension. \n",
    "3. Run all: will run all cells of the notebook sequentially. \n",
    "4. Kernel: allows to specify the kernel in which we want to run our notebook. \n",
    "5. Notebook toolbar: allows to run and edit cells. \n",
    "6. Indicator of type of cell (Python or markdown)\n",
    "7. Cell\n",
    "8. Add new cells \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is composed of a series of cells, each serving as a multiline text input field. These cells can be executed by pressing Shift-Enter, or by clicking the \"Play\" button in the toolbar or selecting \"Cell\" then \"Run\" from the menu bar. The behavior of cell execution depends on its type, with three main types: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells. While every cell begins as a code cell, its type can be altered using a drop-down menu in the toolbar, which will be activated if you press  on the type of cell in the bottom-left corner (i.e., in the image below where it says Python.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Notebooks on VSCode](./img3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main types of cells**:\n",
    "- Code\n",
    "\n",
    "    Allow editing and creating new code, complete with syntax highlighting and tab completion. The choice of programming language depends on the kernel, with the default kernel (IPython) executing Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Upon execution of a code cell, the resulting computation outputs are then showcased in the notebook as the cell's output. This output isn't limited to text; various forms such as matplotlib figures and HTML tables (as employed in packages like pandas for data analysis) are also supported. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Markdown: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Allow you to document the computational process in a literate manner, combining descriptive text with code using rich text. In IPython, this is achieved by using Markdown cells, where text is marked up with the Markdown language. Markdown provides a simple way to emphasize text, create lists, and structure the document using headings indicated by hash signs. Markdown headings become clickable links in the notebook and provide structure hints when exporting to other formats like PDF. When a Markdown cell is executed, the Markdown code is converted into formatted rich text, allowing for arbitrary HTML code for further formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw cells: \n",
    "\n",
    "    They allow to write output directly, meaning they are not evaluated by the kernel when runing the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A workflow in a Jupyter Notebook is run sequentially. As in a script, there is line hierarchy within cells, and there is also sequential hierarchy between cells. However, notebooks have the advantage of allowing us to edit cells separately multiple times until achieving the desired outcome, rather than rerunning separate scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on a computational problem, you can organize related ideas into cells and progress incrementally, moving forward once previous parts function correctly, which is very useful when running codes that have snippets that take long. If at anypoint we want to interrupt running a cell, we can achieve that pressing the interrupt cell. Also, we can restart the Kernel to shut down the computational process. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we run a cell, the notebook sends that process to the Kernel and prints directly the output of the execution. The execution order appears in square brackets to the left of the printed output. Notice that when we run a notebook, all cells are run in the same kernel. This means that whatever we run in a given cell will remain active unless we restart the Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, whenever we shut down a Notebook (either by restarting the Kernel or just saving and closing the notebook), all of our processes and outputs that have not been saved to disk will be erased. \n",
    "\n",
    "> My tip: while notebooks are highly useful for writing and explaining work processes, particularly for others, they may not be as practical for large research projects. Instead, I often work concurrently on a script that I run in a notebook, executing it step by step until all lines of code run smoothly. Once I have finished the code, I only save the script. "

    "4. We typically use only lower case letters for variables, and reserve upper case letters for parameters or constants. \n",
    "5. Names should be self-explaining and balance out brevity and explicability. Typically, we reserve names for variables, verbs for attributes, adjectives for booleans.\n",
    "6. We can use names in any language, but in general English is preferred so that anyone could follow the code.\n",
