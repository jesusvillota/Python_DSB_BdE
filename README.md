# Python Programming for Banking Supervision  
**Diploma de Supervisión Bancaria – CEMFI**  
**Bank of Spain**

### README: Introduction to Python Programming for Banking Supervisors

Welcome to the **Introduction to Python Programming** course, part of the "Diploma de Supervisión Bancaria" at CEMFI. This course is designed specifically for incoming banking supervisors at the Bank of Spain. It is embedded within the broader "Programming" subject and serves as a foundation for your upcoming Data Science course with Joel Marbet.

#### Course Objective

The main goal of this course is to provide you with a practical introduction to programming using Python. By the end of the course, you will be comfortable with the basics of Python and ready to tackle more advanced data science topics.

#### Who is this course for?

This course is tailored for banking supervisors with little or no prior programming experience. All examples and exercises are designed with your professional context in mind, focusing on practical applications relevant to banking supervision.

#### What will you learn?

You will learn:
- The basics of Python syntax and structure
- How to write and run Python scripts
- Working with data types, variables, and control structures
- Reading and writing data files (CSV, Excel)
- Basic data manipulation and visualization
- How to use Python libraries relevant to data analysis (e.g., pandas, matplotlib)
- Best practices for writing clear, maintainable code

#### Course Structure

The course is organized into the following modules:
1. **Introduction to Python and Programming Concepts**
2. **Data Types, Variables, and Operators**
3. **Control Flow: Conditionals and Loops**
4. **Functions and Modules**
5. **Working with Data Files**
6. **Introduction to Data Analysis with pandas**
7. **Basic Data Visualization**
8. **Practical Exercises and Case Studies**

#### Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required. All you need is a laptop with Python installed (instructions will be provided in the first session).

#### Getting Started

1. **Install Python**: Download and install the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Set up your environment**: We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for an interactive coding experience.
3. **Download course materials**: All course materials, including lecture notes and exercises, will be provided via the CEMFI learning platform.

#### Support

If you have any questions or need help setting up your environment, please reach out to the course instructor or teaching assistants.
