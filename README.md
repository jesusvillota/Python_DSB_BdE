# Python Programming for Banking Supervision  

**Diploma de Supervisión Bancaria – CEMFI**  

**Bank of Spain**

**Teacher: Jesús Villota Miranda (PhD Student in Economics, CEMFI)**

### README: Introduction to Python Programming for Banking Supervisors

Welcome to the **Introduction to Python Programming** course, part of the "Diploma de Supervisión Bancaria" at CEMFI. This course is designed specifically for incoming banking supervisors at the Bank of Spain. It is embedded within the broader "Programming" subject and serves as a foundation for your upcoming Data Science course with Joel Marbet.

#### Course Objective

The main goal of this course is to provide you with a practical introduction to programming using Python. By the end of the course, you will be comfortable with the basics of Python and ready to tackle more advanced data science topics.

#### What will you learn?

You will learn:
- The basics of Python syntax and structure
- How to write and run Python scripts
- Working with data types, variables, and control structures
- Reading and writing data files (CSV, Excel)
- Basic data manipulation and visualization
- How to use Python libraries relevant to data analysis (e.g., pandas, matplotlib)
- Best practices for writing clear, maintainable code

#### Course Structure

The course is organized into **two intensive sessions**:

##### **Session 1: Python Fundamentals**
1. **Overview of setup and installation**
2. **Jupyter Notebooks**
3. **Preliminaries**
4. **Basics of Python syntax**
5. **Introduction to `NumPy`**

##### **Session 2: Data Analysis and Visualization**
6. **Introduction to `pandas`**
7. **Visualization: `matplotlib` and `seaborn`**


#### Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required. All you need is a laptop with Python and Anaconda installed (instructions will be provided in the first session).

#### Getting Started

1. **Install Python**: Download and install the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Set up your environment**: We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) along with the `environment.yml` file provided in this repository to create a consistent development environment. Follow the installation instructions provided in the `installation_notes.pdf` file included in this repository.
3. **Download course materials**: Clone this repository or download the ZIP file to access the course materials, including datasets and Jupyter notebooks.
